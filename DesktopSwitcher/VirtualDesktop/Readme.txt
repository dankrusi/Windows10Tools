Powershell commands to manage virtual desktops of Windows 10



Windows 10 introduced a great new feature with virtual desktops, but missed to
document a programming interface to manage virtual desktops from a script or
program. This set of powershell commands helps out and lets you control virtual
desktops from scripts.

Now with support for desktop names introduced with Windows 10 2004!

Update 2.5:
support for desktop names introduced with Win 10 2004
new functions Get-DesktopList, Get-DesktopName and Set-DesktopName
desktop name as parameter for many functions
support for verbose output
Update 2.4: new function Find-WindowHandle
Minor Update 2.3.1: fixed examples
Update 2.3: fixed COM interface error with Pin-Application
Update 2.2: new commands Move-ActiveWindow and Get-ActiveWindowHandle
Minor Update 2.1.1: support for ISE (Get-ConsoleHandle) and RunSpaces (Windows version checking)
Update 2.1: Support for Windows 10 1809
Update 2.0: Support for Windows 10 1803

# Move powershell window to last virtual desktop and switch to it
Get-Desktop ((Get-DesktopCount)-1) | Move-Window (Get-ConsoleHandle) | Switch-Desktop

# Retrieve virtual desktop on which notepad runs and switch to it
Get-DesktopFromWindow ((Get-Process "notepad")[0].MainWindowHandle) | Switch-Desktop

# Pin notepad to all desktops
Pin-Window ((Get-Process "notepad")[0].MainWindowHandle)



Remarks:
For a C# implementation look here: https://github.com/MScholtes/VirtualDesktop

The API is not or rarely documented by Microsoft. So there is a risk Microsoft
changes the API with an os update and this script will then not work anymore
(Microsoft did so already with anniversary update, with 1803 and 1809).
